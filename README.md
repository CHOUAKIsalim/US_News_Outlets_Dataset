# US News Outlets Dataset

Welcome to the News Outlets dataset! Here you will find a comprehensive list of (mostly U.S.) under-the-radar news sources operating on Facebook.

In total, we have gathered 8,488 distinct news domains associated with 10,128 Facebook pages. These news sources, along with their corresponding Facebook pages, are actively monitored by the [CheckMyNews extension](https://github.com/CHOUAKIsalim/CheckMyNews) to collect the news-related posts received by users. 


# Dataset Description - Under-the-Radar News Sites: 

The lit includes web domains that are linked to Facebook pages claiming to be news organizations, irrespective of their reputation and popularity. It includes all Facebook pages that promoted political ads on Facebook from June 2018 to June 2020 and identified themselves as "News Media." Additionally, we extracted the corresponding websites mentioned in the "About" sections of these Facebook pages. The list contains 8,488 distinct domains associated with 10,128 Facebook pages.

# Usage
The "news_outlets_dataset.csv" file contains the comprehensive dataset of news outlets. Each line in the CSV file represents a Facebook page. The file is structured with the following three columns:

1. page_id: This column contains the unique Facebook identifier of the Facebook page.
2. url: This column provides the link to the respective Facebook page.
3. domain: This column represents the associated website linked to the Facebook page. In most cases, this website corresponds to a news domain, as the Facebook pages claim to be news sources.
